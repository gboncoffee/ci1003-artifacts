Extremelly stupid and not really usefull criptography created for Introduction
to Computer Science subject. Based on the long-known and ridiculously simple
Caesar cipher, improved with ideas I had on the bus back from my campus. This
junk implementation only supports the english alphabet, spaces and algarisms.

tyeily stands for "Thank You Eduarda, I Love You". It doesn't mean anything
special, but I wanted to say thanks to Eduarda.

# If you use this in production, you deserve everything that'll happen.
